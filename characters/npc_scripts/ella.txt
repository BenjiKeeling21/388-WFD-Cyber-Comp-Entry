Hi! I'm Flight Sergeant Smith Green...
Welcome to the NCO (Non-Commisioned Officer) Office...
In the air cadets you can work up the ranks and get more...
responsibilities and opportunities...
Here at 388 we have an amazing NCO team which will support you with...
any problems, questions and concerns...
Our NCO team frequently run activities and parade nights for cadets...
to pass on our knowledge and help you guys have a great time!
I'm currently the head of the NCO team here at 388...
so I make sure everything is running smoothly, and help the team develop.
Maybe one day you'll make it on to our NCO team!
I look forward to seeing you around 388!
