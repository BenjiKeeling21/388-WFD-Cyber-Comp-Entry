Hello, I'm Cadet Olszewski!
Firstly, welcome to our main parade hall. This is...
where the majority of our nights are spent. This...
is the beating heart of our squadron where most...
of the action happens. Enough of that though.
Let's talk about radio! Part of the progressive training...
syllabus is radio communications training. I think this...
is really interesting. We learn how to properly communicate...
over the radios, the terminology, and the correct uses of them.
This is a really useful skill and one of my favorite cadet topics!
