Hi, I'm Sergeant Hornegold!
I'll tell you about shooting and fieldcraft opportunities...
in the cadets. In the air cadets, you can train on a few...
different weapons systems, such as the cadet L98 rifle.
Initial weapons training courses teach you how to safely...
handle the weapon, and then to attend live fire shoots, you...
must pass a weapons handling test to ensure everyone know how...
to remain safe during the exercise. Once you've trained on the L98...
you may attend fieldcraft courses which are super exciting! These...
involve lots of fun things including blank firing, and cam & concealment.
Personally, fieldcraft is one of my favorite things to do in the cadets.
I highly recommend you get involved!
