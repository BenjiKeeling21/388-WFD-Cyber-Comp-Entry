Hi, I'm Corporal Keeling!
Welcome to the IT suite. This is home to all the cyber...
magic and the squadron flight simulator. Here at 388 we...
have flight simulator technology to give our cadets the...
opportunity to experience controlling an aircraft prior to...
there first real flight. We also have plenty of computer systems...
that we can learn cyber skills and progress through the...
cadet progressive training sylabus for cyber. My job on...
squadron is to maintain the computers and run the flight sim.
Come to me if you have any more cyber questions!
I was also the one who programmed this interactive tour!
Hope to see you soon!
