Hi! My name's Sergeant Golinski...
and a big warm welcome to 388 Squadron...
please feel free to explore the squadron...
and make sure you talk to everyone to learn more about what we do...
First off, let me tell you about our drill here at 388...
our award winning drill team practices on this very parade square!
We learn drill to improve our discipline, teamwork, and leadership...
which are some of the core values we strive for here at 388...
and drill helps us acheive this...
Personally, I am the banner bearer, which means I represent the squadron...
by carrying our ensign during ceremonial parades and competitions...
Drill is great! I know you're going to love it!
Enjoy exploring the rest of 388! Ill be right here! Bye!
