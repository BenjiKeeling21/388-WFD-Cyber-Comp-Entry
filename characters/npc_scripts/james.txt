Hi! I'm Corporal Gething!
I'm going to tell you about sport in the air cadets!
In the air cadets, there are lots of sporting opportunities...
for example the annual wing and regional athletic...
competitions, and the wing sports teams. In addition...
to this, we regularly run squadron sports nights to keep...
active and stay fit! Hope to see you on the next one!
Gotta run!
