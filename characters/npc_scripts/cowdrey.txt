Hi, I'm Corporal Cowdrewy.
Welcome to classroom 3. It's in this room where...
I'll deliver your first class training. This is...
your initial induction into the air cadets, and...
covers everything you need to know to have a successful...
start to your cadet career! Once this training is complete...
you officially become a cadet and join the rest of the...
squadron for continual activities and training.
I hope to see you soon to begin your first class!
Don't hesitate to explore the rest of the squadron. Bye!
