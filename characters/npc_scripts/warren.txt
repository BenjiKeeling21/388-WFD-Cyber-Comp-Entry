Hi! I'm Corporal Livingstone! Welcome to the staff office!
This is where the magic happens. Here at 388, we have an...
amazing staff team who make everything happen. Our hard-working...
staff like our beloved OC (Officer Commanding) APO Baillie and...
our amazing team of Civilian Instructors and uniformed staff are what...
keeps the squadron open and allows us cadets to have amazing opportunities...
all the time! The staff really do a lot for us here at 388 and we really...
appreciate them.
I hope you enjoy the rest of your self-guided tour!
See you soon!
