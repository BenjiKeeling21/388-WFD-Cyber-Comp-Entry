Hi, I'm Corporal Sikes!
I'm going to tell you about the adventure training...
and The Duke of Edinburgh's award opportunities we have.
Here at 388, we offer lots of adventure training, such as...
paddlesports, rock climbing, and hiking. We're famous for...
being the AT squadron! We also offer all levels of the DofE...
award at a heavily discounted rate than most providers.
They're great opportunities!
