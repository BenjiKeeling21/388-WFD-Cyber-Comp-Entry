Hi I'm Sergeant Matthews!
My specialty is first aid. In the air cadets...
we do lots of first aid training as it is an...
important skill to have, and our training may...
one day save someone's life. I regularly run refresher...
sessions on squadron so every cadet is prepared when...
they need it the most. I hope to see you in the next session!
Bye for now!
